    "\n",
    "1. Sigmoid: The sigmoid function outputs values between 0 and 1, making it useful for \n",

    "However, it suffers from the vanishing gradient problem, where gradients become very small \n",
    "for large inputs, making it harder to update weights during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent): The tanh function is similar to the sigmoid but outputs values \n",
    "between -1 and 1. \n",
    "It addresses some of the issues of the sigmoid, as its range is centered around zero, \n",
    "which helps with the training process. \n",
    "However, it also suffers from the vanishing gradient problem to some extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): ReLU is one of the most widely used activation functions \n",
    "today due to its simplicity and effectiveness. \n",
    "It outputs the input directly if it’s positive, and 0 if it’s negative.\n",
    "ReLU helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and is computationally efficient. \n",
    "However, it can suffer from the \"dying ReLU\" problem, where neurons get stuck during\n",
    "training and stop updating because they output zero for all inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Leaky ReLU: A variation of ReLU, Leaky ReLU allows a small, non-zero gradient when the \n",
    "input is negative. \n",
    "This helps to address the dying ReLU problem and ensures that neurons always have some gradient \n",
    "to learn from during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Softmax: Although not commonly used in hidden layers, the softmax function is typically \n",
    "used in the output layer for multi-class classification problems. \n",
