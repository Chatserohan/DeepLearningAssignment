    "\n",
    "For example, in surveillance footage, a person might walk behind a pillar, making it difficult for \n",

    "Another challenge is motion blur, which occurs when the object moves quickly, causing its appearance \n",
    "to become distorted in the video frame, making it harder to accurately track. \n",

    "Appearance variations also pose a problem, as the object's shape, color, or texture may change due \n",

    "A common example is tracking a person who changes clothing or orientation. \n",

    "Real-time processing is another challenge, as high computational costs can slow down tracking \n",

    "\n",
    "Potential solutions include the use of multi-modal tracking, where different sensor data \n",
